### [PAID BOUNTY - $660] Note Locking - Biometrics/PIN

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Main Skills:**
* React Native
* TypeScript
* Biometric Authentication
* Secure UI States
* Notes Feature Development
* Mobile Security UX
* Reusable Component Architecture

**Bounty Overview:**

Build note-level locking for the warpSpeed Notes experience using biometrics, device authentication, or a user-defined PIN.

This bounty gives users a private vault inside Notes. Users should be able to lock new or existing notes, clearly see which notes are locked, and unlock them only after successful authentication.

Locked notes must stay hidden or obscured until unlocked, and the app should require re-authentication after app restart or after a configurable timeout.

**High-Level Scope:**

The implementation should include:

* Ability to lock a new note
* Ability to lock an existing note
* Authentication using Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint, device PIN, or user-defined PIN where supported
* Clear locked-note state in the UI
* Locked notes hidden or obscured until authentication succeeds
* Secure lock screen for unauthenticated access attempts
* No note content revealed before successful unlock
* Re-authentication after app restart
* Re-authentication after a configurable timeout period
* Ability to remove a note lock through note settings
* Ability to change lock settings through note settings
* Authentication required before removing or changing a lock
* Clear UI indicators such as lock icons or labels
* Clean separation between authentication layer, note-locking logic, and UI components
* Reusable TypeScript and React Native implementation that can be extended later

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
   - Fallback to device PIN/passcode
   - Custom PIN creation and validation
   - Secure storage of authentication preferences

2. **Note Locking Logic**
   - Lock/unlock individual notes
   - Store lock status per note
   - Encryption of note content when locked
   - Timeout mechanism for re-authentication

3. **UI Components**
   - Lock indicator icons
   - Authentication prompt screens
   - Note preview obfuscation
   - Settings interface for lock management

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Secure keychain storage for encryption keys
   - No plaintext storage of sensitive content
   - Proper session management
   - Timeout handling

**Implementation Plan:**


Payment happens after the PR is approved and merged.
